Who does not want to be successful in their career? Nobody isn’t it. 

Does career success only mean reaching the pinnacle in our professional life's? 

Could there be other success parameters worth exploring?

Like many professionals, I grew up in the career with the notion that career success means become the business head of a firm.   This aspiration motivated me to strive hard, stay focused, endure the pain and also brought along with its own rewards.   Till I reached one level below a business head - to that of a functional head.    That’s when I started realising that I may not like to do many things which are required by a Business head.   Went through some conflicting moments when internally that was what I was after for 20 years and as I am nearing it – realising that it is not my aspirational role anymore.

After some soul searching I had to take a call – Aspire for a socially accepted Career Success goal – which was to continue on the path to business head or go for a Career success goal – which I will define for my internal satisfaction, even if it means it is against social norms of career success.

With this clarity – I chose to be a Functional head for last 5 years of my corporate life and subsequently be a soloprenuer as a Career Strategist since 2012 years. 

Key Reflective question which helped me gain this clarity was –

What is the activity that I am willing to take up as a full time career knowing fully well that the corporate fringe benefits will take its own time to come?  

Coaching & Training where my answers which jumped up in my mind.   Put a 2 year transition plan to build my career in this line and eventually glided into this role in one of my last Career crossroads that I was in.

Inviting you on a reflective journey.
